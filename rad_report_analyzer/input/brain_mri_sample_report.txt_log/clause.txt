active:  FINDINGS Evaluation of the brain demonstrates a prominent bilobed right
noverb:  especially left-sided paramedial extra-axial mass centered overlying the posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes
active:  The mass demonstrates heterogeneous signal
noverb:  homogeneous enhancement with mildly irregular
noverb:  smooth contours
noverb:  The mass measures approximately 5

active:  The mass encases the falx
noverb:  the adjacent superior sagittal sinus with evidence of marginal dural thickening
active:  especially extending
active:  posteriorly in the midline splaying the upper leaves of the falx through the level of the upper occipital lobe
noverb:  Prominent reactive changes
novoice: noted
active:  involving the periventricular
active:  subcortical white matter of the left frontal and Page 2 of 2 Report approved on NationalRad | Headquartered: Florida | Diagnostic Imaging Services: Nationwide | 877.734.6674 | www.NationalRad.com parietal lobes with a small amount also involving the right posterior frontal lobe
active:  There is adjacent mass effect without significant lateral shift and no herniation
active:  A smaller enhancing extra-axial mass more suggestive of atypical meningioma
